# Society, Law and Ethics

**Information**: The means to acquire knowledge; intellectual capital

## Ethical issues related to information

### 1. Intellectual property rights

Owner's right to decide how information is to be exchanged, shared or distributed; and at what price

**Ethical issue**: Information must not be exchanged without owner's consent

|                    | **Copyright**                                                | Patents                                                      | Trademark                                                    |

#### Why should intellectual property be protected?

* Encourages creation of new software and improve existing applications
* Ensures new ideas and technologies are widely distributed
* Promotes investment of national economy

#### Violation of IPR (aka IPR infringement)

1. Plagiarism: Stealing someone's intellectual work and representing it as your own work without citing the source of information

   1. How to avoid it:
      * Credit ideas, opinions or theories
      * Credit quotations (spoken or written)
      * Credit paraphrases of others' works

   2. Plagiarism is an offence: It may lead to civil suits and criminal charges which are punishable offences and amount to fine and penalties

2. Copyright Infringement: Using copyrighted work without consent/permission of the copyright holder

3. Trademark Infringement: Unauthorized usage of a mark which is identical/deceptively similar to a registered trademark

### 2. Digital Property Rights

Any information about you or created by you that exists in digital form. All your digital property comprises your **digital estate**

Digital property rights lie with the owner

#### Threats to digital properties

1. Digital software penetration tools: *Cracks* and *Keygens* (tools created by hackers) penetrate your software's registration system and enable unauthorized access
2. Stealing/plagiarizing codes of your digital properties: People may steal source code and make another version of it to sell it under their company name

#### Digital property rights protection

1. Anti-Tamper solutions: Advanced tech to prevent hackers from hacking, reverse engineering or manipulating digital properties
2. Legal clauses: Add a transparent clause in your software's *Terms and service* that prohibits the scraping of your software's code for reuse
3. Limit the sharing of software code
   * Share code only with trusted team members
   * Use a Digital Rights Management (DRM) solution to protect your software from being scraped or decompiled

## Open Source Philosophy and Software Licenses

**Open source software (OSS)**: Software whose licenses do not impose much conditions. Users have freedom to use, study, modify or redistribute the software. While they can be freely used, they need not be free of cost. Read about it [here](https://opensource.org/osd).

**Free software**: Freely accessible software which can be freely used, changed, improved, copied and distributed. Any free software has **4 essential freedoms**:

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

Source: [Free software foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

**FOSS or FLOSS**: Free (Libre) and open source software. The terms **free** and **open source** lay emphasis on the importance of *freedom* and *technical progress* respectively.

### Definitions

* **GNU's Not Unix (or simply GNU)**: The GNU software founded by *Richard Stallman* emphasizes on freedom and offers a wide range of software applications, as well as an operating system.
* **Free Software Foundation (FSF)**: Initiated by *Richard Stallman*, the FSF is a non-profit organization which supports the Free Software Movement and the GNU project. 
* **Open Source Initiative (OSI)**: Founded by *Bruce Perens* and *Erics Raymond*, it specifies the criteria and defines the terms and conditions of OSS.
* **Freeware**: Not to be confused with *Free software*. Freeware is free of cost software that allows copying and distribution in binary format. However, its source code is unavailable and should not be modified. E.g.: *Internet Explorer*. 
* **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**: Leads the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing *common protocols* and *software standards* that promote its *evolution* and *interoperability*.
* **Proprietary Software**: Neither open nor freely available, this software's ***use is regulated*** and its ***distribution/modification is either forbidden or requires permission***. Its source code is not normally available.
* **Shareware**: Can be used and redistributed, but a license fee should be paid after a certain trial period. It differs from FOSS because:
  * The source code is not available.
  * The software cannot be modified. 
* **Copylefted software**: Free software whose distribution terms ensure that all versions/copies of it have the same distribution terms. This way, modified versions are shielded from additional requirements intended to make it proprietary.

### Open Source Licenses and domains

> Open source licenses are licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition - in brief, they allow software to be freely used, modified and shared.

They:

* Make contribution easy
* Make sure original creator gets credit
* Prevent others from claiming your work as their own

#### Creative Common Licenses (CC licenses)

They give permission to copy, modify and distribute the original work by attributing the creator of the work.

| Standard rights             | Obligations                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Copy the work               | Always attribute the creator                                 |
| Distribute the work         | Get permission from creator if it goes beyond the terms of license |
| Display or perform the work | Attach copyright notice                                      |
| Communicate the work        | Indicate or link the license                                 |
| Format shift the work       | Acknowledge the original work and indicate the changes       |

#### GNU General Public License (GPL)

It is one of the most commonly used license for open source projects, and allows users to:

* Copy the software
* Distribute the software however they want
* Charge fees to distribute the software
* Make any modifications to the software

#### Apache License

It grants rights which can be applied to open-source copyrights and patents. These rights are:

* Perpetual
* Worldwide
* Granted for no fee/royalty
* Non-exclusive
* Irrevocable

After crediting contributors, the code can be redistributed but will continue to have the Apache License.

### Public Domain Software vs Proprietary Software

Public Domain software are software which cannot be copyrighted or licensed whereas Proprietary software are not available to the public and require a paid license.  

**Note**: Freeware is not a public domain software as it is free software that is ***copyrighted*** nevertheless.

## E-Waste Management

Electronic waste is also called **e-Waste**, **e-Scrap** and **WEEE** (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment). It refers to discarded electrical/electronic devices. It is categorized under *hazardous waste* by the Indian Government.

### Characteristics of E-Waste

* Fastest growing waste
* Most valuable waste
* Very hazardous waste

**IMPORTANT**: Use proper tools to delete or shred data before disposing off any storage device.

### E-Waste Disposal Process

E-Waste management involves proper recycling and recovery of disposed material, which is done in the following manner:

* **Dismantling**: Removal of parts containing dangerous substances
* **Segregation of ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal and plastic**: This is normally done using the shredder process.
* **Refurbishment and reuse**
* **Recycling and recovery of valuable materials**:
  * Ferrous metals in electrical furnaces
  * Non-ferrous metals in smelting plants
  * Precious metals in separating works
* **Treatment/disposal of dangerous waste**
  * Shredder light fraction: Disposed in landfills
  * CFCs: Treated thermally
  * PCBs: Incinerated
  * Mercury: Recycled/disposed in underground landfills

### Benefits of E-Waste recycling

1. Allows for recovery of valuable precious metals
2. Protects public health and water quality
3. Creates jobs
4. Toxic waste
5. Saves landfill space

## Gender issues while teaching/using computers

### 1. Under Representation

> Only 17% of students in CSC institutions are girls - Reported by leading engineering institution in India

Here are some of the reasons behind this:

* **Preconceived notions**
* **Lack of interest**
* **Lack of motivation**
* **Lack of role models**
* **Lack of encouragement in class**

### 2. Work culture is not girl friendly

To solve these two issues,

* There should be more initiatives and programmes that encourage girls to take up CSC
* The Film and TV censor board should ensure fair representation of female role models
* In the practical rooms, girls should be encouraged to work on their own and find solutions to their problems. Celebrating their successes (both small and big) will instill confidence and interest in them

## Disability issues while teaching/using computers

### Types of disabilities

1. Locomotor disabilities
2. Hearing and speech disabilities
3. Cognitive impairment
4. Vision impairment

### Issues due to disability

1. Unavailability of teaching materials/Aids
   * **Visually challenged** students: Need screen readers and lessons without visual inputs
   * **Hearing impaired** students: More visual input, sign language
   * **Locomotor disabilities**: Virtual keyboards, with:
     * Virtual keyboard software
     * Joystick
     * Programming editor that can be interfaced with the virtual keyboard (without mouse)
   * **Low vision** students: Braille keyboards, Braille monitors, Braille printers, screen readers
2. Lack of special needs teachers
   * E.g.: A teacher who knows sign language for hearing impaired students
   * Teachers who know specialized software/hardware
   * Software features and voice assistants for visually impaired students:
     * Microsoft's **Narrator**, **Cortana** and Ubuntu's **Orca** and **onBoard**
     * **BLinux** - Linux for the blind
     * Accessibility features
     * Specialized editors
3. Lack of supporting curriculum: Curriculum should be designed while keeping focus on **inclusive education**.
   * E.g.: Office software based curriculum is inclusive as office software have *accessibility features*
   * Programming languages can be implemented as specialized editors are available
   * Block based languages like Scratch lack accessibility features and hence should not be used
   * CSC/Programming contests should also be all-inclusive

### Possible solutions

* Proper budget allocation in schools to promote inclusive education by making required aids/materials available
* Proper budget allocation to employ special needs teachers or train staff to interact with such students in an inclusive way
* Schools should support an inclusive curriculum and refrain from practices which puts disabled students in a disadvantaged state
