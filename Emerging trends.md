### Artificial Intelligence

> Ability of a machine or computer program to think, learn and evolve

- Basic goals:
  1. Mimic human thought process, behaviour
  2. Act in a human-like way: ***rational, intelligent, ethical***
- Modern AI abilities:
  1. Works with minimal human intervention
  2. ***Creates, updates*** knowledge base
  3. Heuristic abilities (***learns*** from past mistakes to develop a practical solution)
- AI today:
  1. Sophia, social humanoid
  2. Siri/Alexa, personal assistants
  3. Google's NEST, smart home device
  4. Tesla self driving cars
  5. Online games

#### Machine learning

> Machine learning is an application of AI that has the ability to learn and improve from experience, without explicit programming

- Independent - provides solutions by ***finding patterns*** in databases
- Recognizes patterns on the basis of ***models, data sets***

#### Working of ML

> It works on leveraging algorithms that learn data from an iterative process

- Learning methods:
  1. Input of training and testing data
  2. Algorithms, commands (models)
- Learns, grows, changes, evolves
- Finds info without being told where to look

#### Applications of ML

- Face recognition
- Online campaigns
- Virtual personal assistants
- Online chatbots
- Advertising
- Autonomous vehicles

------

- Other capabilities : Wireless communication, is a microcontroller, Analog to digital conversion, Digital processing, Decision making, Two-way communication

------

### Cloud computing

> Internet based computing

- ***Resources, software, information can be shared***
- Cloud = represents the internet
- Facilitates delivery of computing services from a remote location
- Characteristics:
  1. On-demand self-service: ***Provides, monitors, manages*** computing resources without human administrators
  2. Broad network access
  3. Rapid elasticity: Resources able to scale in and out quickly and on needed basis
  4. Resource pooling
  5. Measured service: Utilization of resources is tracked
- Ex: Google drive, iCloud, One Drive, Microsoft Azure

### Clients

> Hardware + Software that access cloud services

- Thick client: fully functional desktop
- Thin client: devices that only have the functionality needed to accomplish the necessary tasks - Smartphones, tablets

### Cloud services

### Types of clouds

- Four types:
  1. Private
  2. Public
  3. Hybrid
  4. Community

|                    | Private cloud                                                | Public cloud                                                 |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Owned, operated by | One buisness/org                                             | Third-party cloud service provider                           |
| Location           | Company's intranet or hosted data centre (with firewall protection) | Cloud tenant (regional location that houses the servers providing cloud services) and other computers connected |
| Shared over        | Intranet                                                     | Internet                                                     |

### Blockchain Tech

> A blockchain is a distributed ledger (storing all the transactions) across a ***peer-to-peer (P2P)\*** network

- Every transaction detail (block) is sent to all connected clients.
- Every new block is chained with earlier existing blocks (blockchain)
- [This video makes it a lot easier to understand](http://youtu.be/SSo_EIwHSd4)

#### Key terms

- **Blockchain technology** is a decentralised, digitized, public ledger of each of the online transactions (***mostly financial, but not always\***) occuring among a network of peers.
- A **block** refers to a secured data chunk that stores encrypted details of a valid transaction that has occured online.
  1. It has two parts: A) Header - Public to all B) Private details of the transaction - Accessible only to the owner
- A **blockchain** is the group of linked blocks
  1. Blocks are linked to each other
  2. Arranged in chronological order
  3. Stores trail of transactions
- A **public ledger** is the blockchain containing all the confirmed transactions
- **Mining** is the process of confirming a transaction after validation, and adding it to the public ledger.

#### Working of the blockchain

- Each block contains:
  1. Data (Details of transaction)
  2. Hash
  3. Hash of previous block
- No transaction can be deleted
- **Bitcoin â‰  Blockchain**
- Security systems:
  1. Hashing
  2. Proof-of-work

| Who can participate in transactions? | Members of consortium                           | Users who satisfy a pre-established criteria | Determined by private org                                    | Public |
