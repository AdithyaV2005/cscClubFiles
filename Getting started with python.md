# Getting Started With Python

## Introduction

Python is a programming language which was developed by Guido Van Rossum in February 1991. Python is based on two programming languages:

- ABC language, a teaching language created as a replacement of BASIC, and
- Modula-3 

Python is an easy to learn yet powerful object oriented programming language.

## Advantages of Python

- **Easy to Use**: Python is an object oriented language with very simple syntax rules. It is a very high level language and this very-very programmer-friendly.
- **Expressive Language**: Python has fewer lines of code and simpler syntax.
- **Interpreted Language**: Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. It makes a python easy-to-debug language
- **Its Completeness**: Majority of the required functionality is available through various modules of python standard library
- **Cross Platform Functionality**: Python can run equally well on variety of platforms like Windows, Linux, etc...
- **Free and Open Source**: Python language is freely available along with its source code
- **Variety of Usage /Application**: Python has evolved into a powerful, complete and useful language Over these years.

## Disadvantages of Python

- **Not the Fastest Language**: Python is an interpreted language not a fully compiled one. So, Python offers faster development times but execution times are not that fast compared to some compiled language
- **Lesser Libraries than C, Java, Perl**: Python offers Library support for almost all computing programs, but it's Library is still not competent with languages like C, Java, Perl as they have larger Collections available.
- **Not Strong on Type - Binding**: Python interpreter is not very strong on catching 'Type-mismatch issues.
- **Not easily convertible** to other programming languages.

## Working in Python

We can download and install python in various ways They are:

* Default installation from www.python.org: 
  * It is also called **CPython installation**
  * It comes with python interpreter, Python IDLE and Pip (package installer)

- Anaconda Python distribution:
  - Highly recommended distribution
  - Comes with many packages and Libraries
- Many popular IDLEs are also available like Spyder IDLE, Pycharm, etc.. 



We can work with python in the following ways

1. in Interactive mode
2. in Script mode

## Working in Default CPython Distribution.

It comes with comes with python interpreter, Python IDLE and Pip (package installer).

### Interactive Mode:

In this mode, we type one command at a time, and then, python executes the given command there and then and gives the output.

### Python Shell:

The interactive interpreter of python is also called python shell.

### Script Mode:

In this mode we can save all the commands in the form of program file and can see all the output lines together. To work in the script mode we need to follow the given steps

1.  Create program File: 
   * **File → New** to create
   * **File → Save** to save

2. Run program File: **Run → Run module** or **F5 key**

## Working in Jupyter Notebook and Spyder IDLE

Anaconda distribution provides the following tools that you can use to world in python.

1. Jupyter notebook
2. Spyder

### Jupyter notebook:

It is a web based, interactive computing environment.

### Spyder:

It is a powerful Python IDLE with many useful editing, interactive testing and debugging features.

## Working in Jupiter Notebook

1. Launch Anaconda Navigator
2. From the navigator window, launch supy tes notebook title
3. It will be launced in a web browser as Jouster Notebook is a web based computing environment
4. click the new dropdown button and select Python 3 to create a notebook for executing Python 3.x code.
5. It will open a new notebook where you can write and run the code
6. To run Python code in interactive mode, type code in code cell and click "Run"
7. To run a script (a) Write the code of a Python Script in a code cell.    (b) Now click on it's name and give it a new name    (c) click on save icon frirst to save it (d) Click Run to run the Script.

## Working in Spyder IDLE

Spyder is a powerful interactive development environment for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features. It is one of the most recommended development environment for Python Language.

## Steps to Launch Spyder IDLE

1. Launch Anaconda Navigator
2. Click on Spyder file in Anaconda navigator.
   Start button → Programs → Anaconda (folder name)→ Spyder

## Interactive Mode

To work in interactive mode in Spyder IDE, type your command in Ipython console pane of spyder window. It will give you output of the command there itself

## Script Mode

To work in Spyder IDE, type your script's command in the editor plane.

- To start a new script file, click File → New File ....
- To save current script, use command *File → Save* (Or) *File → Save As*
- Python Scripts have File extensions as *.py*
- Select the file type as Python Files
- Run the script by clicking at Run icon on the Toolbar. 

## Writing and compiling Python Program with Command Line in Linux 

Steps to create and run a python program in Linux platform : 

1.  Write your program code in a text editor
2. Save your program with .py extension 
3. Compile and run on the command prompt by giving appropriate command. 



### Typing Python Program in a text editor 

There are various types of text editors when we use Linux. Some of them are command line editors Like nano, vim, etc., Or we can use GUI editors like sublime text, atom, etc... 

#### Coding In Text (Sublime Text) 

1.  Open Sublime text 
2. Create a New file: This can be either done by using command File → New or by pressing Ctrl+N 
3. A new file will open
4. Save the file with proper extension *(.py)*. This can be either done by using command *File-> Save* or by pressing *Ctrl+S*

## Print statement

Syntax:

```
print(<objects to be printed>...)
```

Example:

```
print('The Golden Ratio')
print("has the same letters as")
print("The God Relation")
```

Output:

> The Golden Ratio
>
> has the same letters as
>
> The God Relation
